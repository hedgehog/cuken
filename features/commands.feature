Feature: Executing commands
  In order to test a running local system
  As an administrator
  I want to use Aruba steps to run commands and test output

  Background:
    Given that "cuken/cmd" has been required

  Scenario: Check Stdout
    When I run `echo 'i like cheese'`
    Then the stdout from "echo 'i like cheese'" should contain "i like cheese"

  Scenario: Check Stderr
    When I run `some_error`
    Then the stderr from "some_error" should contain "No such file or directory - some_error"

  Scenario: Check Stdout for multiple lines
    When I run `echo 'one\none\none\n'`
    Then the output should contain:
    """
    one
    one
    one
    """

  Scenario: Check exit code
    When I run `true`
    Then the exit status should be 0

  Scenario: Check exit code
    When I run `false`
    Then the exit status should be 1
